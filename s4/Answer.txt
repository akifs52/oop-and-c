Here is a possible implementation of the class:

[cpp]
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

class RegularPolygon {
private:
  const int n; // number of sides
  const double s; // length of one side
  double area; // area of the polygon
  double angle; // one interior angle in degrees

public:
  // constructor that takes number of sides and length of one side as parameters
  RegularPolygon(int n, double s) : n(n), s(s) {
    // calculate and store the area and angle using formulas
    area = (n * s * s) / (4 * tan(M_PI / n));
    angle = (n - 2) * 180.0 / n;
    // print some messages for testing
    std::cout << "A regular polygon with " << n << " sides and " << s << " length is created.\n";
    std::cout << "Its area is " << area << " and its angle is " << angle << ".\n";
  }

  // member function that returns the area of the polygon
  double getArea() {
    return area;
  }

  // member function that returns one interior angle in degrees
  double getAngle() {
    return angle;
  }

  // member function that increments the number of sides by one
  void incrementSides() {
    // create a new polygon object with one more side and same side length
    RegularPolygon newPolygon(n + 1, s);
    // copy its data members to this object
    area = newPolygon.area;
    angle = newPolygon.angle;
    // print some messages for testing
    std::cout << "The number of sides is incremented by one.\n";
    std::cout << "The new area is " << area << " and the new angle is " << angle << ".\n";
  }
};
I hope this helps you understand how to design a class for a regular polygon in C++. If you have any questions or feedback, please let me know. ðŸ˜Š
